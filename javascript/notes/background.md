# Background

- Javascript is typically JIT (Just-In-Time) compiled via V8-Engine into machine code which makes it faster than interpreted languages like Python but slower than compiled languages like C++.
- Javascript is single threaded and is slow in CPU bound tasks. It is good for I/O bound tasks.
- Javascript is dynamically typed and weakly typed.
- Javascript is asynchronous and non-blocking. It uses event loop to handle multiple tasks concurrently.
- Javascript is a Garbage Collected language.
